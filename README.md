# voice-corpus-tool
A tool for creation, manipulation and maintenance of voice corpora

## Installation
The tool requires Python packages `pydub` and `intervaltree`.
You can install them from the project root using the following command:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For processing samples also the `sox` command line tool is required. You can install it using your normal package manager or retrieve it from [here](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).

## Usage
Basic principle of the voice corpus tool is to apply a series of "commands" to a virtual buffer of samples. 

### Illustrating example
Imagine you have a folder full of audio samples. The following example shows how to play a bunch of them.

```
$ ./voice.py add '/data/sample-00300*.mp3' skip 2 take 3 play
Added 10 samples to buffer.
Removed first 2 samples from buffer.
Took 3 samples as new buffer.
Playing:
Filename: "/data/sample-003002.mp3"
Transcript: ""
Filename: "/data/sample-003003.mp3"
Transcript: ""
Filename: "/data/sample-003004.mp3"
Transcript: ""
Played 3 samples.
```

The first command __add__ requires one parameter. In our case we pass `'/data/sample-00300*.mp3'` in apostrophes to ensure the shell is not resolving the asterisk, but just forwards it to the tool which will do the wildcard processing instead.
This operation adds all wildcard-matching samples to the virtual buffer. To document this fact, it prints "Added 10 samples to buffer.".

Now the second and third commands (__skip__ and __take__) and their respective output should explain themselves.

Finally the command __play__ results in playing all remaining samples of the buffer. As they were directly added as files, there is no transcript associated with them. If samples were loaded from a voice corpus CSV file (like provided by the Common Voice project), each (voice) sample would feature its transcript. This transcript will then be kept associated to its sample throughout all further 1-to-1 processing of this sample.

Be aware that the "buffer" is virtual in the sense of not loading any audio data into memory. Its purpose is just to assign operations to sequences of samples. Only final output commands like __write__ or __play__ and the command __augment__ result in actual sample processing (on a file by file basis).

For getting a complete list of supported commands just use the help command like this:

```
$ ./voice.py help

Named buffers:

  set <name> 
	Replaces named buffer with contents of buffer
	Arguments:

  play  
	Play samples of current buffer

  write <dir_name> 
	Write samples of current buffer to disk
	Arguments:
		dir_name: string - Path to the new sample directory. The directory and a file with the same name plus extension ".csv" should not exist.
